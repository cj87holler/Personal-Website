# Personal-Website
This is my first project on github. 
I am using this website as a starting point for html and CSS. I am in the process of learning javascript, however, I was anxious to start putting some elementary skills into practice. I discovered how to do some basic popup animations using CSS and Javascript, and here it is beginning to take shape. It is a long way from being completed, and hopefully this will show my progress as I grow in my web development skills.
